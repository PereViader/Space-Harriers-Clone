This is the second project made from the ground up as an assignment for the UPC Master's degree in videogame creation and design.
This software uses [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) as the fundation for sprite rendering, sound playback, and input gathering.
All the assets used in the game where ripped manually or using [Gens KMOD emulator](http://gendev.spritesmind.net/page-gensK.html).
